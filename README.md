A triangulation of the [Miller cylindrical projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_cylindrical_projection). The coordinates in the text file for the image are given by pixel coordinates from the [source image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_cylindrical_projection#/media/File:Miller_projection_SW.jpg) with the exception of Antarctica, which is given in terms of longitude and latitude. Mathematica code for generating the images and a 3D version is included as well. Includes the landmasses:
